Hello there!

I'm Xavier. I'm currently trying to make a career change into IT.

I'm currently learning a lot and and expanding my skills through my homelab practice. 
I'm running Ubuntu on a Raspberry Pi that is serving as my home server.
I have several projects that I am working on that are mainly focused on running services through Docker containers.
I am most excited about learning Linux and System Administration.

I'm looking forward to sharing all my projects through github and am open to any feedback!
